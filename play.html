    <h5>FOURTH ACT :_Sitting-room in Mrs. Arbuthnot’s House at Wrockley_.</h5>

        <h6 class="ALICE">ALICE</h6>.  <P class="speech">Mrs. Arbuthnot’s compliments, my lady, but she has a bad
headache, and cannot see any one this morning.</P>  <p class="stagedirection">[_Exit_ R.C.]</p>

<h6 class="LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h6>.  <p class="stagedirection">[_Rising_.]</p>  <P class="speech">A bad headache!  I am so sorry!  Perhaps
    you’ll bring her up to Hunstanton this afternoon, if she is better,
    Gerald.</P>

<h6 class="GERALD">GERALD</h6>.  <P class="speech">I am afraid not this afternoon, Lady Hunstanton.</P>

<h6 class="LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h6>.  <P class="speech">Well, to-morrow, then.  Ah, if you had a father,
    Gerald, he wouldn’t let you waste your life here.  He would send you off
    with Lord Illingworth at once.  But mothers are so weak.  They give up to
    their sons in everything.  We are all heart, all heart.  Come, dear, I
    must call at the rectory and inquire for Mrs. Daubeny, who, I am afraid,
    is far from well.  It is wonderful how the Archdeacon bears up, quite
    wonderful.  He is the most sympathetic of husbands.  Quite a model.
    Good-bye, Gerald, give my fondest love to your mother.</P>

<h6 class="MRS. ALLONBY">MRS. ALLONBY</h6>.  <P class="speech">Good-bye, Mr. Arbuthnot.</P>

<h6 class="GERALD">GERALD</h6>.  <P class="speech">Good-bye.</P>

<p class="stagedirection">[_Exit_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.  GERALD _sits down and reads
    over his letter_.]
    </p>
<h6 class="GERALD">GERALD</h6>.  <P class="speech">What name can I sign?  I, who have no right to any name.</P>
<p class="stagedirection">[_Signs name_, _puts letter into envelope_, _addresses it_, _and is about
    to seal it_, _when door_ L.C. _opens and_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT _enters_.
    GERALD _lays down sealing-wax_.  _Mother and son look at each other_.]</p>

<h6 class="LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h6>.  <p class="stagedirection">[_Through French window at the back_.]</p>  <P class="speech">Good-bye again,
    Gerald.  We are taking the short cut across your pretty garden.  Now,
    remember my advice to you—start at once with Lord Illingworth.
    </P>
